Start to write your post here. Think of this section as the summary, the details can go below the `<!--more-->` marker. This marker separates the summary of the post from the details.

<!--more-->

Do not remove the `<!--more-->` marker. Continue to write your article in the markdown format.

# Note on images

All images can have local path and the caption can be added next to the path as in the example below
